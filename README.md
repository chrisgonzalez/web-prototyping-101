# Web Prototyping 101

The files contained heretofore provide some really simple starting places for creating web prototypes. All directories contain a starter javascript, css, and html file, as well as a copy of jQuery so you can work locally.

### Blank Starter Pack

The world is your oyster with this one- totally blank, go nuts!  

### Navigation Starter Pack

This contains a basic two-piece web page with navigation and an area for the rest of your web things.

### Media Query Starter Pack

This contains the CSS to toggle visibility on three separate divs based on screen size. Use this for responsiveness!

### Stateful Starter Pack

This comes with a simple stateful class toggle via jQuery. Click the button for MAGIC.
